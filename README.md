## 🚀 Suggestions to Improve

If you want to make this UI even better, try:

* Making the design responsive using `max-width` and media queries
* Replacing fixed height values with padding for more flexibility
* Adding placeholder validation using JavaScript
* Adding animations (button hover, input focus)
* Improving accessibility by adding `<label>` for the input

Example of making the input responsive:

```css
.box3 input {
    height: 60px;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 600px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```
